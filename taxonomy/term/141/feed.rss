          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;SDS for School Leavers – Key Learning Points&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Schools and social work services need to work out better ways of identifying pupils that may be eligible for social work support from age 14. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pilotlight.iriss.org.uk/resources/local-authority-transitions-team-solution-card&quot;&gt;Local authority transitions teams&lt;/a&gt; could achieve this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Parents and carers are often assumed to know more about the transition process than they actually do. There is a need for timely and relevant information from age 14 onwards. A &lt;a href=&quot;https://pilotlight.iriss.org.uk/resources/transitions-table-parents-nights-solution-card&quot;&gt;Transitions Table at Parents Nights&lt;/a&gt; would be a good means of providing this information.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The prospect of change can be very unsettling for final year pupils, intensely so for those with autism. Close attention should be paid to anxiety management. &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.yogameditationandhealing.co.uk/downloads/music-online-mp3/guided-visualization-download-777&quot;&gt;Relaxation sessions&lt;/a&gt; can help. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Technology can engage young people in planning for the future. Young people are often more digitally literate than practitioners and this can shift the balance of power &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.iriss.org.uk/resources/tools/witty-whats-important-you&quot;&gt;WITTY (What’s Important to You?)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;School leavers and their parents/carers found visits to support provider organisations helpful in understanding the types of support available.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Small &lt;a href=&quot;https://pilotlight.iriss.org.uk/resources/test-budgets&quot;&gt;‘test budgets’&lt;/a&gt; to try out activities and supports can help final year pupils and their supporters plan for the future.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Imaginative ways of facilitating school leavers and parents/carers to explore and commission shared supports are needed. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pilotlight.iriss.org.uk/resources/locality-based-transitions-forum-solution-card&quot;&gt;Locality-based transitions forums&lt;/a&gt; could support this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Keeping in touch and sharing information with other parents and young people can be managed through a closed &lt;a href=&quot;https://pilotlight.iriss.org.uk/resources/hints-and-tips-setting-facebook-group&quot;&gt;Facebook group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
