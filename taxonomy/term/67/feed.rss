          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Zealand family photo montage&quot; height=&quot;685&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; class=&quot;media-element file-web-3x2&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://pilotlight.iriss.org.uk/sites/pilotlight.iriss.org.uk/files/styles/web_3x2/public/media/PL2-Alex_DxOPsp.jpg?itok=hQa3ffLc&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In our third Pilotlight pathway we are working with a co-design team of people who deliver and access support in Moray to look at how self-directed support can be used for small business development.&lt;br /&gt;
	 &lt;br /&gt;
	Right from the start, co-design team members have been eager to hear real stories from people who have pioneered using self-directed support in this way.  At our second workshop Alex, Barbara and Paul Zealand came to talk to us and to answer questions about how they had used self-directed support to set up and run Alex’s handyman business.&lt;br /&gt;
	 &lt;br /&gt;
	Alex has a handyman/odd jobs business. He provides a range of services to older and disabled people in Buckie, including lawn mowing, window cleaning, patio cleaning, fence painting and garden furniture sanding and treatment. Alex loves what he does, especially the lawn mowing. He is very popular with his clients, many of whom look forward to his visits and to having a cup of tea and a chat with him.&lt;br /&gt;
	 &lt;br /&gt;
	Alex’s mother Barbara explained that Alex had been due to leave school last summer and start college. A couple of months before he was due to start, Alex told her he did not want to go to college.  So they had to act both creatively and quickly because they did not want Alex to go to the day centre full time (he goes one day a week in order to keep up with his network of friends from school).&lt;br /&gt;
	 &lt;br /&gt;
	They applied for a direct payment (one of the self-directed support options). In this option the Council pays you an amount of money (based on an assessment of your needs) and you (or someone acting on your behalf) choose and arrange your support services. Barbara and Alex decided to spend Alex’s direct payment on employing three support workers (also known as personal assistants) to support him to run a handyman business. They could also have applied for a grant to purchase the specialist equipment Alex uses in his business (rechargeable strimmer and lawnmower) but due to the short time they had to set up, they went ahead and bought this themselves.&lt;br /&gt;
	 &lt;br /&gt;
	Barbara and Alex recruited his support team with help from the Direct Payments worker at Moray Council, who put their advert into the Job Centre. They recruited Paul, Willie and Tracy. They were not necessarily looking for people with experience of care work, but for people with the right attitudes who Alex liked and got on well with. Recruiting their own staff gave them control. One of the staff they recruited is a joiner and is passing on some skills to Alex.&lt;br /&gt;
	 &lt;br /&gt;
	Barbara told us that the SDS assessment process was very easy. They have a payroll company who works out all the tax and national insurance, but they pay the staff themselves.&lt;br /&gt;
	 &lt;br /&gt;
	At the moment Alex is on Employment Support Allowance. This means he can earn up to £20 per week after all his business expenses have been paid before he loses any benefit. Alex’s charges for his services are lower than other businesses to keep his earnings below this amount. The long term goal is for him to come off Employment Support Allowance.&lt;br /&gt;
	 &lt;br /&gt;
	From starting with three clients through his church network, Alex now has 15 clients and a waiting list. Alex has friends who are currently at the day centre who would like the opportunity of having or being part of a small business. Barbara has approached the day centre to offer them the opportunity for someone to come and work with Alex but so far they have not taken this up. As Barbara explained, this is not an easy option, being an employer can seem very scary and she cannot make it happen for everyone, but it is has been the right thing for Alex.&lt;br /&gt;
	 &lt;br /&gt;
	Barbara left us with three very inspiring messages:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Try It!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don’t be afraid of failing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can change it as you go along&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

 <title>Working in Co-design Teams</title>
 <link>https://pilotlight.iriss.org.uk/blog/working-co-design-teams</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=&quot;Card - I want to speak&quot; height=&quot;685&quot; width=&quot;1024&quot; class=&quot;media-element file-web-3x2&quot; typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://pilotlight.iriss.org.uk/sites/pilotlight.iriss.org.uk/files/styles/web_3x2/public/media/PL2-co-design-team_2.jpg?itok=TtcyYrYL&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pilotlight is a project about co-designing pathways to self-directed support for groups of people who have so far been less engaged with the self-directed support agenda.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Co-design can be defined as, &lt;em&gt;“the process of designing with people that will use or deliver a product or service.”&lt;/em&gt; (UK Design Council). Co-design may be seen as the first step in co-production, &lt;em&gt;“which means delivering public services in an equal and reciprocal relationship between professionals, people using services, their families and their neighbours. Where activities are co-produced in this way, both services and neighbourhoods become far more effective agents of change.”&lt;/em&gt; (NESTA)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have been working in co-design teams in Moray and the Scottish Borders throughout the two Pilotlight pathways since January 2013. In this blog post we want to talk about the way we work and some of the benefits of working in this way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a key principle of service design (the design approach being used throughout Pilotlight) we are using co-design to help us to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Deeply understand the barriers to accessing self-directed support for people with mental health problems in Moray and for people who require support with decision making in the Scottish Borders.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design solutions to these barriers to increase the capacity of support providers and people using the services to deliver self-directed support.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Pilotlight co-design teams include people who use and deliver services. In Moray, the co-design team has helped us to conduct action research within their local community and practitioner groups and identify key barriers to people with mental health problems accessing self-directed support. We are now beginning to develop solutions with the group. Some of the creative tools we have used include:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Asking co-design team members to find and present examples of effective information design (in any media) to the group, from which the team identified the components of good information design.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Considering a general leaflet about self-directed support to identify how it could be enhanced to address the specific information needs of people with mental health problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asking each co-design team member to develop a ‘persona’ or character profile of someone who has lived experience of mental health problems or of a mental health practitioner and then developing these characters together for use in designing solutions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building scenarios to identify where and how information about self-directed support should be provided.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Engaging in role plays to identify how the generic SDS assessment process needs to be tailored for people with mental health problems.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Key to the success of co-design in Pilotlight is working from the basis that experiences of service users are of equal value to the knowledge and experience of professionals who deliver services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On this basis, we spent time at the beginning of the project developing values and principles to guide us all in undertaking our Pilotlight work. These have been informed by the principles set out in the Scottish Government’s self-directed support strategy, which are based on a human rights approach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through using creative tools and designing our workshops to be as engaging and innovative as possible, we also hope to build co-design facilitation skills within the local authorities and provider organisations who we are working with.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The ideas of Professor Edgar Cahn are an inspiration to us. We think this video explains why co-production is worth doing. Enjoy!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>We&#039;re nearing the end of our ‘Discover’ phase...</title>
 <link>https://pilotlight.iriss.org.uk/blog/were-nearing-end-our-discover-phase</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;In our last blog we talked about how we intended working with the co-design teams in Moray and the Scottish Borders. We have now held workshops with both teams. We are nearing the end of our ‘Discover’ (research) phase of the pathway in Moray and part of the way through this phase in the Scottish Borders.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Moray we are working on the theme of ‘Access to self-directed support for people with mental health problems’. We have eight people who access mental health services and one unpaid carer, along with practitioners from social work, health promotion and service providers, on the co-design team. We held the first workshop with the people who access services and the unpaid carer. We felt we needed to give them the same opportunities the practitioners had already had to find out more about Pilotlight and decide whether they wanted to participate before bringing the whole co-design team together. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the first workshop we looked at:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Well-being &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;An introduction to Pilotlight and self-directed support&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lived experiences of mental health problems &amp;amp; services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Preparation for participatory action research&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Feedback on the day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also had a lunch to which we invited the practitioner members of the co-design team. Everyone who came along was asked to bring a physical object that represented something that keeps them well. We asked everyone to introduce themselves and tell us about their object. People brought along a whole range of objects, including motorcycle gloves, welly boots, mobile phones, and a log. But by far the most popular object was a photograph of a pet cat or dog. These featured much more frequently than photographs of partners or children! &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone went away from the first work shop equipped with interview schedules, recording equipment and cameras to do some research into mental health awareness in Moray. They then presented their findings to the whole co-design team at the second workshop. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Key findings were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Many people didn’t know very much about mental health services in Moray unless they were already using them&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A lack of understanding and knowledge about mental health came across strongly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Generally people were unsure as to how they would access services&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most people would speak to their GP&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internet and leaflets were the most common information sources mentioned&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a lack of information&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a lot of stigma associated with mental health&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the second workshop we identified the barriers to access to self-directed support for people with mental health problems, but also the opportunities it offers. These included:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Flexibility, Choice – of service, worker, location&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ability to plan ahead&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More and different opportunities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Try new things out. Purchase service for a trial period.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More control : building self-confidence and self-esteem&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creativity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Most effective services will flourish&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opportunities for micro enterprises&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Short term solutions for short term problems&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Opportunities for individuals to pool their budgets &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help people who want something else or who have fallen through the cracks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do away with service monopolies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the third workshop we will be deciding which of the barriers we want to focus on designing solutions for. Already identified is the need for information specific to people with mental health problems. Everyone went away from the second workshop with research assignment : to find one or more pieces of effective information. We await the ‘show and tell’ session at the workshop next week with anticipation!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

 <title>The first meeting with Pilotlight’s Provider Network</title>
 <link>https://pilotlight.iriss.org.uk/blog/first-meeting-pilotlights-provider-network</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-hidden&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;On Wednesday 3rd October we met 25 support providers from across Scotland at the Scottish Youth Theatre venue, Glasgow. The day was the first meeting of the Pilotlight Provider Network and was a great success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We invited a mix of providers from the voluntary and private sector alongside local authority providers to join our network for the duration of the Pilotlight project. They will provide assurance on the evidence emerging from the pathways, ideas on solving challenges, information on barriers and share examples of good practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At our first meeting, we asked some big questions including, &lt;strong&gt;‘what does self-directed support mean to you and your organisation?’&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;‘what is your organisation currently doing around self-directed support?’&lt;/strong&gt;. Also, &lt;strong&gt;‘what are the barriers to delivering self-directed support?’&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;‘what are your organisation doing to overcome these barriers?’&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These questions generated a lot of great discussion and revealed some really valuable insight for the Pilotlight project and also the individual pathways. Some of the key areas of insight were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Culturally, the move to self-directed support for providers is presenting many barriers around language and understanding. Simple solutions like a glossary of terms would be useful for providers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There is a need for planning time and clarity around who will lead support planning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Getting the balance between choice and risk right is a concern and was a common theme which emerged from the providers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ensuring that self-directed support is outcomes focused. There is a fear that at a local authority level, inputs and outputs are the focus.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;More transparency about planning and strategy is required from local authorities. There is also a need for more co-production by providers and the people using services.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There are barriers around finance, contracting and commissioning including block contracting and how this will be affected, the nature of contracting requires change and some provider frameworks aren’t user friendly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A general requirement for more information; in the marketplace and also for people and families to get information about their options.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;We also asked the support providers to help us analyse our research frameworks which will be used throughout the ‘Discover’ phase of Pilotlight. With their help, we interrogated the questions we will ask people using services, local authorities, commissioners and support providers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our next meeting with the Provider Network will be in February 2013 and we are already looking forward to presenting our Pilotlight research back to them. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
