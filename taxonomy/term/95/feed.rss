          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ageing Well with Self-directed Support : Key Learning Points&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Older people are assets to their communities and want to be seen as contributors to society. We celebrated the older people in the Ageing Well co-design team by commissioning Inkwell portraits, each with a short story, from artist Andy Archer, ‘to remind all generations that older people are treasure troves of adventure and knowledge’. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pilotlight.iriss.org.uk/resources/inkwell-portraits-older-people-assets&quot;&gt;Inkwell portraits&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Building a community asset map can help people identify the opportunities for community involvement. Mapping and sharing knowledge and information about community assets is essential for strengths based approaches to self-directed support conversations and planning. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pilotlight.iriss.org.uk/resources/community-asset-map&quot;&gt;Community Asset Map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Health and social care workers need to become skilled community connecters to support creative planning with people and achieve the outcome of building a person’s connections and relationships within their local community. Their employers need to provide them with the resources to acquire and develop these skills. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pilotlight.iriss.org.uk/resources/community-connecting-abcd&quot;&gt;Community Connecting ABCD&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lack of transport and / or inaccessible transport can be a barrier to older people (and others) engaging in their communities. Finding solutions to these transport barriers can tackle social isolation and help older people re engage with activities and people they used to enjoy. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pilotlight.iriss.org.uk/resources/transport-solutions&quot;&gt;Transport Solutions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;As more and more self-directed support information has become available, the need for consistency and quality control has become apparent. The Ageing Well co-design team designed a checklist for anyone giving information about self-directed support to support good practice and synchronisation between information and advice providers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pilotlight.iriss.org.uk/resources/sds-information-checklist&quot;&gt;SDS Checklist&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Making self-directed support Option 2 a reality would offer greater choice and control to older people for whom managing a direct payment is not possible. Looking beyond traditional care and support providers to alternative organisations may open up this option. In East Renfrewshire, the Self-directed Support Forum is piloting Option 2 for older people. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pilotlight.iriss.org.uk/resources/easy-steps-directing-your-support&quot;&gt;Easy steps to directing your support&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Who is it for?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;The transport brief is for anyone interested in finding solutions to transport barriers that prevent older people (and others) from engaging in their communities.&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-above&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;What does it do?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;By setting out solutions to transport barriers it seeks to tackle social isolation and help older people re engage with activities and people they used to enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;field field--name-field-resource-how field--type-text-long field--label-above&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;How can you use it?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;The questions in the design brief can be used to explore local solutions to transport barriers. The ideas generated in East Renfrewshire can be used as inspiration.&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;

 <title>Getting from hours to outcomes</title>
 <link>https://pilotlight.iriss.org.uk/resources/getting-hours-outcomes</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field--name-field-resource-who field--type-text-long field--label-above&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;Who is it for?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;The Getting from Hours to Outcomes Learning Materials are for anyone looking to transition  from commissioning or delivering care and support by time and task to outcomes led care and support.&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;field field--name-body field--type-text-with-summary field--label-above&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;What does it do?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The Getting from Hours to Outcomes Learning Materials explore two support scenarios for the fictional character of Betsy. One scenario asks groups to design support to meet Betsy’s outcomes using a weekly budget and the other scenario asks groups to design support to meet Betsy’s outcomes using an annual budget. When the groups come together they should be able to reflect on the pros and cons of the two scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;field field--name-field-resource-how field--type-text-long field--label-above&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;field-label&quot;&gt;How can you use it?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;
          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;The Getting from Hours to Outcomes Learning Materials could be used to promote learning within teams of practitioners or individually.&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
