          &lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;h2&gt;SDS and Mental Health: Key Learning Points&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The prospect of change can be very difficult for people with mental health problems. The self-directed support options are best introduced to this group starting with option 3. &lt;a href=&quot;/resources/pick-n-mix&quot;&gt;Pick ‘n’ Mix&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bespoke assessment questionnaires are required for people with mental health problems and other fluctuating conditions to assess for when people are well and unwell. &lt;a href=&quot;/resources/mental-health-self-assessment-questionnaire-saq&quot;&gt;Mental Health Self Assessment Questionnaire&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People with mental health problems should be supported to plan in advance for how they will manage their self-directed support when their condition fluctuates and they become unwell. This is best done as an extension to assessment and support planning. &lt;a href=&quot;/resources/sds-add-support-plan&quot;&gt;SDS add-on to Support Plan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Continuing to block fund crisis support services and develop Option 2 (known as Individual Service Fund) for people in recovery is an effective way of delivering self-directed support for people with mental health problems. &lt;a href=&quot;/resources/guidance-developing-individual-service-funds-people-fluctuating-conditions&quot;&gt;Guidance for developing individual service funds for people with fluctuating conditions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;SDS learning and development is most effective when practitioners and people who access support learn together. People with mental health problems can be very effective co-trainers. &lt;a href=&quot;https://pilotlight.iriss.org.uk/resources/sds-and-mental-health&quot;&gt;Content and methods to deliver SDS learning and development&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
